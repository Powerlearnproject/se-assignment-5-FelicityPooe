    - For C++: { "name": "C++", "type": "cppdbg", "request": "launch", "program": "main.exe" }
4. Set breakpoints: Set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the left gutter next to the line numbers.
5. Start debugging: Press F5 or click the "Run Code" button to start debugging.
6. Debugging features: Use the debugging features available in VS Code, such as:
    - Variable inspection: Hover over variables to see their values.
    - Step through code: Use F10 to step over, F11 to step into, and Shift + F11 to step out.
    - Call stack: View the call stack to see the current function calls.
    - Breakpoints: Manage breakpoints and conditional breakpoints.
    - Console: Use the built-in console to execute code and see output.

Some key debugging features available in VS Code include:

- IntelliSense: Get code completions, function signatures, and variable information.
- Code navigation: Jump to definitions, references, and symbols.
- Error detection: See error messages and warnings in the editor.
- Performance profiling: Use the built-in profiler to analyze performance bottlenecks.
